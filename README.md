# go-neural-test

This is a [test case](https://github.com/NOX73/go-neural-play/blob/master/play/multiply.go) taken from [go-neural-play](https://github.com/NOX73/go-neural-play), with some modifications to have more sane sample size (so that it doesn't run for hours on end) and more comments in the source to better explain what's going on. The test should take a couple of minutes with a fairly modern PC.
