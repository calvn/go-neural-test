# go-neural-test

[go-neural](https://github.com/NOX73/go-neural) is a great entry point to learn about [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). This repository provides an example on how it can be used.

Particularly, this is an [example](https://github.com/NOX73/go-neural-play/blob/master/play/multiply.go) taken from [go-neural-play](https://github.com/NOX73/go-neural-play). It contains some modifications for a more sane sample size (so that it doesn't run for hours on end), as well as more comments in the source to better explain what's going on.

The example should take no longer than a couple of minutes to finish with a fairly modern PC.

## Trying it out

To run the example, simply fetch all the dependencies and then execute `go run main.go`
